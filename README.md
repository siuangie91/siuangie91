Hello! I am Angie Siu. Currently I am a software engineer at the New York Times. My focus is on e2e JavaScript and web development. (NYT Name: [@angiesiuNYT](https://github.com/angiesiuNYT))

I am a down-to-earth colleague and care deeply about helping other developers grow. I am completely self-taught (no bootcamp, no CS degree!) and understand how hard it can be to learn to code.

When not coding, I am probably cooking or eating; I'd say that food is my passion! I particularly enjoy making ramen and pasta.

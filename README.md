Hello! I am a software engineer. My focus is on e2e JavaScript/TypeScript and web development.

I am a down-to-earth colleague and enjoy helping other developers grow. I am completely self-taught (no bootcamp, no CS degree!) and understand how hard it can be to learn to code.

When not coding, I am probably cooking or eating; I'd say that food is my passion! I particularly enjoy making ramen and pasta, and geeking out on food science.
